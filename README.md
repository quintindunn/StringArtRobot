# StringArtRobot

### **\*Important\***
### This project is NOT completed, and is going through more revisions. I would not recommend building it, unless you've gone over everything and too agree it will work, even then that's do it at your own risk!

## About
This is a project to automatically make string art from an input image. I got the idea for this project from [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGccIFf6MF8&ab_channel=VirtuallyPassed) YouTube video by [Virtually Passed](https://www.youtube.com/@virtually_passed).
The logic for generating the sequences is based off [this gist](https://gist.github.com/kaspermeerts/781f0137b361b51224dcab722ae387b4#file-stringart-py) by [kaspermeerts](https://github.com/kaspermeerts), implemented in my [threadArt python library](https://github.com/quintindunn/threadArt).
